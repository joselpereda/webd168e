      <p class="lead intro text-muted">
        Jose Pereda was born in a rural town in Jalisco, Mexico—commonly known as tequila country. He and his family immigrated to the U.S. in 1979 and were raised in the Los Angeles suburbs. Today, he's the only sibling to leave the nest. Married for nearly 20 years, Jose and his wife have five children, ranging in age from toddler to adult. His professional journey has taken him across the globe—especially Latin America—while working in leadership roles in global enterprises.

              Jose is supported by a loving family—his wife and five children (two girls and three boys). Their family mantra, "Work for what you want—don’t expect anyone to give you anything," drives them to be ambitious and self-reliant. It’s a philosophy that pushes both parents to stretch their time and resources to enable their children’s pursuits.
